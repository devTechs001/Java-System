### Java Library Management System
## Project Overview
The Java Library Management System is a software application designed to manage library functions, including keeping records of books, allowing online access to reading articles, and facilitating other related actions. This application aims to streamline library operations and enhance user experience.

## Features
Book Management: Add, update, delete, and search for books.
User Management: Register new users and manage user profiles.
Article Access: Provide online access to reading articles.
Borrowing System: Allow users to borrow and return books, track due dates.
Reporting: Generate reports on book availability and user activity.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
XAMPP installed for database management.
MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver) for database connectivity.
MySQL Server and Workbench Setup

## Step 1: Install MySQL Server and Workbench
Download MySQL Installer:

Visit the official MySQL website and download the MySQL Installer for Windows.
Run the Installer:

Right-click the downloaded installer file and select Run as Administrator.
Choose Setup Type:

Select the Custom option on the Choosing a Setup Type window and click Next.
Select Products and Features:

Ensure the following options are selected:
MySQL Server 8.x (x64 version)
MySQL Workbench CE 8.0.x (x64 version)
Leave all other options unchecked.
Configure MySQL Server:

In the Type and Networking window:
Select Server Machine from the Config Type drop-down menu.
Check the TCP/IP checkbox and set the Port Number to 3306.
Check Open Firewall port for network access.
Set Root Password:

During the installation, you will be prompted to set a root password. Choose a strong password and remember it for later use.
Complete Installation:

Follow the remaining prompts to complete the installation. Click Finish when done.
## Step 2: Configure MySQL Server
Launch MySQL Workbench:

Open MySQL Workbench from your desktop or start menu.
Create a New Connection:

Click on the Local instance MySQL80 button to connect to your MySQL Server.
Enter the root password you set during installation and optionally check the Save password in vault box.
Configure Options:

In the Navigator pane, click on Options File under the INSTANCE section.
Adjust settings as needed, such as:
sql-mode: Add ,ANSI_QUOTES to the existing string.
Timeout Settings: Set interactive_timeout and wait_timeout to 30.
Apply Changes:

Click Apply to confirm any changes made to the configuration.
Start and Stop Server:

In the Navigator pane, click on Startup / Shutdown to manage the MySQL server instance. You can start or stop the server as needed.
Step 3: Create the Database and Tables
Access phpMyAdmin:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Create the Database:

Click on the "Databases" tab.
In the "Create database" field, enter library_management and click "Create".
Create Necessary Tables:

Select the library_management database from the left sidebar.
Click on the "SQL" tab to run SQL commands.
Run the following SQL commands to create the necessary tables:

CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    isbn VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    published_date DATE,
    available_copies INT DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE borrow_records (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    book_id INT NOT NULL,
    borrow_date DATE NOT NULL,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
);

## Step 4: Connect Java Application to MySQL Database
Add MySQL Connector/J to Your Project:

Download the MySQL Connector/J from the official MySQL website.
Add the JAR file to your Java project's build path.
Establish Database Connection:

Use the following code snippet to connect your Java application to the MySQL database:

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_management";
    private static final String USER = "root";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password_here";

    public static Connection getConnection() {
        Connection connection = null;
        try {
            connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return connection;
    }
}

## Step 5: Implement Core Features
Book Management:

Create methods to add, update, delete, and search for books in the database.
User Management:

Implement user registration and profile management functionalities.
Borrowing System:

Develop methods to handle book borrowing and returning, including due date tracking.
Reporting:

Create functions to generate reports on book availability and user activity.
